    <p class="leading-loose mt-2 font-inter text-stone-600">During my work experience, I joined Resolute Health as an IT Summer Intern. On the first day of my experience and training, I was given a tour of the office, introduced to the company's operations, and informed about my responsibilities for the summer. My training consisted of learning to use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, the Freshworks Service Dashboard for handling support tickets, Excel automation, and more. The time spent on training was not extensive due to the workload, as most days were consistently busy with IT support tickets. My training on the Microsoft 365 Admin Center was in-depth, and I learned how to navigate the interface and use it for my daily work tasks. Next, I was trained on the Freshworks Service Dashboard, where I learned to respond to the support tickets assigned to me. I was asked to perform Excel automation using formulas and scripts, which provided a valuable training and learning experience for me. I haven't had to make any suggestions for problem areas, but I do offer suggestions whenever I notice something that could be improved. Although my program wasn’t exactly related to Full Stack Application Development, it is still relevant to the information technology field, which is why I applied for this job as a work term. While my time with this company is limited to the summer, I will look for more opportunities directly related to my field of study in the future. This experience has affected my attitude greatly, it was very kind and a respectful work environment to be in every day since I started working with them and how professional the office setting is.</p>
    
    <h1 id="Conclusions" class="text-2xl pt-12 mb-2  font-inter text-stone-600">Conclusions</h1>
    <p class="leading-loose mt-2 font-inter text-stone-600 pb-12 ">My strengths in this experience include my prior knowledge of working in the IT field and my applicable customer service skills. My weaknesses involve unfamiliarity with some new technologies and adapting to the company’s work environment. I have learned that the people working there are very professional and friendly, which made me feel very welcomed during my work term. I found that most people working there have a positive attitude towards work and their interactions with others. During my time there, I noticed that everyone treats each other with mutual respect, which I have enjoyed. This work term helped me collaborate with others in various ways, including working with the IT team and other staff members during support sessions, where I provided IT support as required by the tickets. This experience has affected me in many ways toward people and the future, by becoming a better IT professional and respectful to others in the future jobs to come. Overall, this work term was a great experience and I enjoyed working in an office setting for IT and I do hope to be soon working within a Full Stack Developer role after this internship.</p>
